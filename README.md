Post-install checklists
- Confirm that the plugin appears in the installed plugins list within ComfyUI.
- Confirm that the Qwen-Image model loads without errors.
- Verify that memory usage stays within the expected range for 24GB VRAM when generating images.
- Validate both CPU and GPU paths are functioning as intended for your hardware.

Configuration and optimization
- VRAM management: The plugin is designed for high VRAM usage. Be mindful of other memory-heavy processes running in parallel.
- Model selection: If you have multiple Qwen-Image variants installed, ensure the plugin is configured to load the intended one.
- Precision and sampling: Start with default settings and adjust prompts, sampling steps, and resolution gradually to avoid out-of-memory errors.
- Caching: For repeated runs, enable caching of intermediate results if your workflow benefits from it.
- Seed handling: Use fixed seeds for reproducibility when testing prompts.
- Logging: Enable verbose logging during debugging to capture errors and performance metrics.

Usage scenarios
- Creative image generation: High-detail portraits or landscapes with complex textures.
- Style transfer and editing: Apply style concepts to base images with fine control over texture and lighting.
- A/B testing prompts: Run multiple prompts in parallel to compare results and refine prompts quickly.
- Batch processing: Generate a batch of images with consistent settings to scale content production.

Example prompts and configurations
- Basic portrait with realistic lighting:
  - Prompt: ‚Äúa realistic portrait of a young woman in soft studio lighting, high detail, natural skin tones‚Äù
  - Settings: 50 steps, 0.8 CFG, 1024x1024 resolution
- Cinematic landscape with texture:
  - Prompt: ‚Äúepic mountain landscape at dawn, dramatic lighting, high detail, expansive depth, ultra-realistic textures‚Äù
  - Settings: 70 steps, 0.75 CFG, 1280x720 resolution
- Abstract concept art:
  - Prompt: ‚Äúabstract robotic city, neon glow, geometric shapes, vibrant color palette, high contrast‚Äù
  - Settings: 60 steps, 0.9 CFG, 1024x1024 resolution

Tips for quality and speed
- Start with medium resolution and a moderate step count to gauge performance.
- Increase steps for finer detail only after ensuring the base image meets expectations.
- Use a balanced CFG scale to ensure fidelity without overfitting prompts.
- Monitor VRAM usage with system tools to avoid unexpected swaps or crashes.
- If slow, consider reducing image resolution or using a less memory-intensive model variant.
- Keep drivers up to date to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.

Troubleshooting common issues
- Plugin not showing in UI: Confirm that the asset was properly extracted and placed in the plugins directory. Restart ComfyUI after installation.
- Out of memory during generation: Lower the resolution, reduce steps, or switch to a lighter model variant. Close other GPU-intensive applications.
- Model loading errors: Check that you downloaded the correct asset for your OS. Ensure the Python environment and dependencies match the needed versions.
- Crashes during startup: Review the log files for stack traces. Look for known compatibility notes in the Release notes and ensure your GPU drivers are current.

Security and safety
- This plugin is a local integration for image generation. It does not transmit your data to external servers.
- Follow standard digital hygiene when downloading assets: verify checksums if provided, and obtain releases from the official repository.
- Respect license terms of any models used through the plugin. Ensure you have rights to run and modify the models in your environment.

Performance and benchmarking notes
- On a system with 24GB VRAM, expect substantial headroom for high-quality renders and larger prompts.
- Rendering speed depends on prompt complexity, image resolution, and model version.
- For reproducible experiments, record seeds, prompts, and settings. Save configurations used in successful runs.

Architecture and design decisions
- The plugin adheres to the ComfyUI plugin interface, minimizing changes to core code.
- It isolates Qwen-Image logic from ComfyUI‚Äôs main processing pipeline to reduce coupling.
- The integration handles input conversion, result retrieval, and error reporting in clearly defined stages.
- It supports both Windows and Linux through platform-specific asset handling.

Compatibility and constraints
- Supported platforms: Windows and Linux, with GPU-backed rendering required for the full Qwen-Image model.
- VRAM requirements: 24GB VRAM is recommended for the full version. Lower VRAM may work for lighter variants.
- ComfyUI version compatibility: Use a reasonably recent build of ComfyUI that supports plugins and the expected Python environment.
- Python and dependencies: The plugin bundles necessary runtimes for stability, but a compatible environment is still essential for best results.

Extending and contributing
- If you want to extend the plugin, follow the repository‚Äôs contribution guidelines.
- Submit pull requests with clear goals, tests, and changelogs.
- For new prompts, add examples in the examples/ directory to help other users reproduce results.
- Maintain compatibility with future ComfyUI plugin interfaces by keeping interfaces stable and well-documented.

Code and implementation notes
- The plugin uses a modular interface to load and run Qwen-Image within the ComfyUI framework.
- It includes adapters for input and output to align with ComfyUI‚Äôs node-based flow.
- The code avoids heavy coupling with the generator‚Äôs internal details, making it easier to update.
- Tests cover basic load, a simple generation, and memory usage checks under typical prompts.

Troubleshooting and diagnostics (deep dive)
- Start with a minimal prompt to establish a baseline. If it works, gradually add complexity.
- Check memory trends during a run. If memory spikes occur, profile the pipeline step by step to identify the culprit.
- Use verbose logging and capture stack traces for any crashes. Cross-check the traces with known issues listed in the Release notes.
- Validate that your GPU driver is current. Some performance or stability issues are driver-related.
- If the plugin reports a missing file or module, verify the plugin‚Äôs directory path in ComfyUI‚Äôs configuration. A misconfigured path can prevent proper loading.
